• Create .pdf or .docx documents that can be submitted as manuscripts, reports or formatted to the requirements of a specific scientific journal.  
• Create a dynamic R page (R package `shiny`)  
• Practice, hopefully learn some tricks and find out were to get more info about Rmarkdown.  

**#Currently, the repo contains (note that I'm still working on preparing the workshop):**    
• Both the .Rmd and .html format for the main workshop intro (`rmarkdown_main.Rmd` and `rmarkdown_main.html`)  
• The .Rmd file for the second part of the workshop (`rmarkdown_otherformats.Rmd`)   
• A `figures` directory with some example figures I loaded  
• A `biblio` directory with an example bibliography  
• A `csl` directory with some example .csl files.
