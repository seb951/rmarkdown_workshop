{\#}{\#}{\#}m{\'e}thodes

5.RAxML.

{\#}{\#}Questions
1.Is there a max. number of loci needed? Figure 4, plateaus at 3 million base pairs... Not necesseraly, because more loci recovers more intraspecific groups... but they are not (never) fully resolved because ongoing hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting.
2. How far (genetically divergent) can we use GBS for diff. species)...

{\#}{\#}{\#}r{\'e}sultats
-phylogenie r{\'e}solue. esp{\`e}ces monophyletique.
1. 89k stacks (chaque individus max de 59k, min de 1844 stacks).
2. phylogenie pas support{\'e} avec jeu de donn{\'e}es avec tr{\`e}s peu de donn{\'e}es manquantes
