## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```
summary(cars)
There are a lot of cars
I hate them
```

\> Quoted text: 1st way       
\> more quoted text       
\> still more quoted text   
  
> Quoted text: 1st way      
> more quoted text       
> still more quoted text        
  
\`Quoted text: 2nd way\`       
\`more quoted text\`         
\`still more quoted text\`     
  
`Quoted text: 2nd way`     
`more quoted text`       
`still more quoted text`       
  
\```  
\Quoted text: 3rd way     
\more quoted text         
\still more quoted text       
\```   

```  
Quoted text: 3rd way    
more quoted text         
still more quoted text        
```
# WTF

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
