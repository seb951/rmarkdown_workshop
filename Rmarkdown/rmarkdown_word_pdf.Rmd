# Different outputs {.unnumbered}
* There are five versions of this document. We will examine them:
  + *.Rmd*: The `R markdown` document. 
  + *.html*: A webpage as we saw in the previous section. Follow workshop using this version. 
  + *.docx*: A MS Word document.
  + *.tex*: A [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) document.
  + *.pdf*: A Portable Document Format.

* You can specify it when you create a new `Rmarkdown` document.  
  
* You can also specify it later in the header.     

* Then, it's just a matter of kniting the document!      

  
# Microsoft Word  
```word

```

* Little documentation, few options & configurations are possible (This is probably not the format that should be promoted, as it moves away from an open source environment).  

* Can specify a [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) OpenDocument Text (`output: odt_document`) or Rich Text Format (`output: rtf_document`) instead. 

* FYI, there is a spellchecker in `Rstudio`: Edit >Check Spelling...

# Portable Document Format (.pdf)

* You need an extra step to go from a LaTeX (*.tex*) format to a *.pdf*. This is handled by the `R tinytex pdflatex` function in R.

* [LaTeX software](https://www.latex-project.org) is a high-quality typesetting system.

* It is the *de facto* standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.

* LaTeX is available as free software [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

* If interested, follow this discussion: [*Why LaTeX is such a bloated system?*](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=395863)

* So...[*TinyTeX*](https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/) is a custom LaTeX distribution that is small in size (~150MB) but functions well in most cases, especially for `R` users .

* `tinytex` ![](../figures/tinytex.png){width=25px} is an R studio package that installs *TinyTeX*.  

* You should know have all the tools to generate your fully reproducible manuscripts in `R`! 


# Exercice 1  
* If you haven't done so, install the `tinytex` R package from the console and run `install_tinytex()`. It may take a few minutes to download and compile (~150MB).   
  
```tinytex  
install.packages("tinytex")  
library(tinytex)  
install_tinytex()  
```  

* Create a new document, compile it as *.pdf*.  
  * Add a Table of Content. 
  * Add a graphic.

* Now compile it as a Word document  (*.docx*)

* Add some reference by specifying the `csl: ../csl/peerj.csl` and `bibliography: ../biblio/test_library.bib` in the header  

# Further customization

## `rticles`   
* R packages `rticles` is a (potentially) useful package to format articles according to the specification of a journal.

* But first, you need to install it in the R console.
```rticles
install.packages("rticles")
```

* Once installed, you can start a new R markdown document according to your journal of interest.

* Right now, few templates available. 

* Some templates may be slower to render, depending on what *LaTeX* package they depend on and need to be installed.

## LaTeX template: manuscript  
* This allows further options in the *.Rmd* file when going from *.tex* file to *.pdf*.  

* You can build your own *.tex* template if you know LaTeX...     

* But, there are also many templates available on the web that you can use.  

* Here is one I like for [manuscripts](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates/blob/master/svm-latex-ms.tex) (Thanks [svmiller](https://github.com/svmiller) on ![](../figures/octocat.png){width=34px})   
  
  + For example, using this template, I am writing a scientific paper [entirely in R markdown](https://github.com/seb951/Acadian_seaplants/blob/master/manuscript_Rmd/Acadian_seaplants_v5.pdf).

  + The only real objection I see, is integrating the comments of co-authors.

## LaTeX template: CV

* Here is a template I like for [*Curriculum Vitae*](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates/blob/master/svm-latex-cv.tex)    

  + For example, using this template, I re-wrote my [CV](http://sebastien.renaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cv.pdf) to give it a fresh look!

* Let's briefly examine and knit the *svm-rmarkdown-cv.Rmd* file in the reference_material directory.

* You can also generate Powerpoint-like presentations.

# Bookdown
* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) ![](../figures/bookdown.png){width=20px} is an open-source R package that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown.
