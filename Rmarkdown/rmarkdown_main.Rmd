&nbsp;  

* Follow the *.html* (web browser) and the *.Rmd* (Rstudio) documents. Try and experiment.  

* ~2 hours: Introduction and practice      

* ~15 minutes: pause  

* ~1 hour: other formats (*.docx*, *.pdf*). [Workshop here](https://seb951.github.io/rmarkdown_workshop/Rmarkdown/rmarkdown_word_pdf.html)    

* ~15 minutes: shiny. [Workshop here](https://sebastien.shinyapps.io/shiny/)  
  

# Markdown
* Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** with plain text formatting syntax (Easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format). It is designed so that it can be easily converted to HTML and many other formats (e.g. PDF, MS Word, .docx).  

* Like other markup languages (e.g. HTML and Latex), it is completely independent from R.  

* Typically, file have the extension *.md*.    

* Look at this [example](https://github.com/seb951/rmarkdown_workshop/blob/master/README.md). Examine the html render (github automatically interprets *.md* files) and raw file.     
![](../figures/md_example.png){width=500px}

# R Markdown
* An extension of the markdown syntax that enables **R code to be embedded and executed**.  

* Generate **fully reproducible reports** in different of static and dynamic output formats.  

* Most of these packages are maintained by the Rstudio team  (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/, ![](../figures/yihui.png){width=20px} [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/))    

* Plain text files that typically have the file extension *.Rmd*.  

* So, how does it work:
    + Write text & code in `Rstudio`.
    
    + Knit: The R package `rmarkdown` feeds the *.Rmd* file to the R package `knitr`.   

    + `knitr` executes code and creates a new markdown (*.md*) document which includes the code and output.  

    + Subsequently tranformed into *.html*/*.tex*/*.docx* by `pandoc`. (Note that *.tex* files need to be transformed by `pdflatex` into *.pdf* files. We'll come back to that later.)  

    + [`Pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) is an universal document converter, independent of `R`.

    + By default, `Rstudio` comes with `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, and `pandoc` (but not `pdflatex`).  

    + When you click the **Knit** button (top left), a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of  `R` code within the document.

## Exercice 1: Setting up an R markdown file (10 min.)
* This is easily done through `R studio`  
   
![](../figures/getstarted.png){width=500px}  
&nbsp;      
  
* file > new file > R markdown > HTML   

* Save it ("myfirstRmarkdown.Rmd")   

* Knit

![](../figures/knitr.png){width=500px}  
&nbsp; 

* Examine the *.html* output.   

* Examine at the *.Rmd* file structure.   


# R markdown syntax
* Markdown provides an easy way to make standard types of formatted text, like:    

    + *italics* (\*text\*) or _italics_ (\_text\_)  

    + **bold**  (\*\*bold\*\*)

    + backslash (\\) to interpret a special characters as character  

    + \# and space at the beginning of line for a header level (6 levels, \# to \#\#\#\#\#\#)

    + _**bold italic**_ (\_\*\*bold italic\*\*\_) 

    + [links](https://www.rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  (\[links](https://www.rmarkdown.rstudio.com))     

    + Two spaces for a newline character  

    + "\&nbsp;  " character (html *N*on-*B*reaking *SP*ace) for extra line spacing can be useful.  
  
    + list (first element using \* and space, then *idented* (tab or 2 spaces) \* and space)
      + item 1a
      + item 1b  
    
    + `quoted text` (\`quoted text\`)  
    
***

* The [cheatsheet v1](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) or [v2]([cheatsheet v1](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)) is your friend.  


## Exercice 2  (10 min.)
* Lets write some text now (add italicized/bold text, some URLs, and an itemized list, have fun!). Convert the document to a webpage.  


# Header
```
---  
title: "Rmarkdown"  
author: "Sebastien Renaut"  
date: '2018-03-12'  
output: html_document  
---  
```  

* Header, metadata, YAML, YAML Ain't Markup Language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#History_and_name) ?  

* Header specifies configurations (what kind of document will be created, and the options chosen).   

* It is not required (defaults then apply).  

* It uses `Python`-style indentation to specify certain options.  

* Many options possible depending what type of document you are generating. See below for some examples.  

* Note that some options can be specified either for the whole document (in the header), the code chunks, or both (chunks options supersede header). More on code chunks later.  

# Customizing header
```  
---  
title: "Rmarkdown"  
author: "Sebastien Renaut"  
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`"   
output: 
#pdf_document:
 html_document:  
   highlight: tango  
   number_sections: T  
   theme: united 
   toc: yes  
   toc_depth: 3  
---  
```  
  
* Note the indentation in the **.Rmd** document for the *output* options.
* Note the **#** symbol to comment out option.   
* Note that date is population via an `R` function  

## Outputs 
See the [documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html) for more information. But these are some formats of interest:  

* `output: html_document`   

* `output: ioslides_presentation`  

* `output: pdf_document` (This will require that you have a [Latex software](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed - We'll get to that later).    

* `output: word_document` (*.docx*)   

* interactive `shiny` apps (We'll get to that later). 

## Customizing header: Table of content
* `toc: yes` Generate TOC.   

* `toc_depth:3` depth of TOC.    

* `number_sections:T` Add section numbering to headers.  

* More options [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#table-of-contents)
    
## Customizing header: Theme, highlight & other options
* `theme: ` specifies the theme to use for the page  ("cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", and "cosmo").  
  
* `highlight: ` Syntax highlighting style (e.g. "tango", "pygments", "kate", "zenburn").  

* See this [Reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for more options. 

## Exercice 3 (10 min.)
* Change theme of your `Rmarkdown` document    
* Change highlighting      
* Add TOC    
* Try saving it as `output: word_document`    
* Save, knitr and play with options.     

# Code chunks
* The real power of `R Markdown` comes from mixing markdown with chunks of code.    

* A code chunk is intepreted by `knitr`. It works essentially the same as the `R` syntax we are familiar with.  
  
* A main code chunks may look like this:  


>\```{r code chunk example, include = T, message = T, warning=T, echo = T, fig.cap="Figure 1"}  
>#Running some R code.
>x = rexp(1000)  
>min(x)  
>max(x)  
>plot(x)  
>\```    

* On the 1st line, I specify that I will run the `R` programming language.  

* Then, I give the chunk a **UNIQUE** name and specify options.   

* Here are common options:  
    + `include = F`: Code and results will NOT appear in the finished file. Code is still interpreted, and the results can be used by other chunks.    
  
    + `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.  
  
    + `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.    
  
    + `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.    
  
    + `fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphical results.    
  
    + `fig.width=...`, `fig.height=...` can also change figure width/heigth.    

* By default `R studio` creates a *Global Options* code chunk. Let's examine this chunk:    

>\```{r setup, include=FALSE}  
>knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)  
>\```  

* see [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more info.   

* Note that you also run inline code using the using the \`   \` symbols and specifying the programming language. For example, \` r 10+5 \` would be processes as `r 10+5`.

## Exercice 4 (10 min.)
* Add a code chunks that will:
    + load an R package and make a plot  
    + load an R package and print some output of a function     
* Run inline code.  
* Can you find options to print code, but not run it?   
* Also, try clicking the green arrow in the *.Rmd* on the right to execute a code chunk a preview its output. 

## More Code chunks
R markdown can read and execute different languages!    
  
* **bash**
```{bash}
ls -1
```

* **python**  
```{python}
x = "hello python!"
print(x.split(' '))
```

* **perl**  
```{perl}
print "Hello perl!";
```

## Math symbols
Mathematical material is set off by the use of single dollar-sign characters (similar as in the LaTeX typesetting language).  

* So to write $E = mc^{2}$, you'd write:  **\$E = mc^{2}\$**   

* $\sum_{i=1}^n ASV$    

* $F_{(1,69)}$ =   1.27, *p*-value=0.26   

* $A = \pi*r^{2}$

* $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$

* If you wish to use a dollar sign, you need to preface it with a back-slash $E = mc^{2}$ versus \$E = mc^{2}\$  
  
* The use of double dollars quote allows for displayed formulas (centered). $$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$  

* See [more](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/regression/RMarkdown/example.html) example equations from this McGill math Rmarkdown tutorial.  

# Include pictures & figures.
* There are several ways to include figures.   

* Can be included from an URL directly uploaded from the web:  
`![optional caption here](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/12/11/naturo-monkey-selfie.jpg){width=250px}`  
   
![Optional caption here](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/12/11/naturo-monkey-selfie.jpg){width=250px}  
&nbsp;   
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   

* If this figure is small, it can be added to the text directly: eg.: Today, we are using  ![](../figures/rstudio.png){width=44px} to generate webpages with ![](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/12/11/naturo-monkey-selfie.jpg){width=30px} images...

* This is a graph previously saved in the *figures* directory   
`![](../figures/DEG_heatmap.png){width=250px}`   
![](../figures/DEG_heatmap.png){width=250px}
&nbsp;  

* In all these cases, graphs are rendered with `pandoc` and not `knitr`, so pandoc options need to be specified, not R graphics options:  
    + It's simple, but options are tricky.  

    + You may need to play with spacing, figure size, and figure position.  

    + Options are specified directly after the URL or link (eg. {width=250px} or {width=50%}).  

* Images can also be interpreted by `knitr` as below:  
  
>\```{r graphic_example, out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "An orange man", echo = F,fig.align = "center"}  
>knitr::include_graphics("../figures/orange.jpeg")  
>\```
  
```{r graphic_example, out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "An orange man", echo = F,fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/orange.jpeg")
```

* Graphs can also be generated directly by `R` code, specified in a code chunk (`R` options specified in the code chunk) and interpreted by `knitr` as we did previously.  
 

```{r another example, echo = T, message = F}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars_ggplot = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + 
geom_point() + geom_smooth()
mtcars_ggplot
```

# Including Tables
* By default, R Markdown displays data frames and matrices as they would be in the R terminal (in a monospaced font). ![](../figures/vomit.png){width=39px}   

* You can use the `knitr::kable` function for additional formatting, as in the *.Rmd* file below.  

```{r table, echo=T}
#Default R printout (ugly)
print(head(mtcars))

#With kable function from knitr (better looking)
knitr::kable(head(mtcars),digits =1,caption = "A motorcars table")
```

## Exercice 5 (10 min.)
* Find a picture on the web.     

* Add it to document using either `knitr` or `pandoc`.  

* Add a table using `knitr`.  

# Citations, footnotes, bibliography
* Footnotes are easy when you have a few references. Use `[^1]` and add reference at the end using same format [^1].    

* Otherwise, you may specify a bibliography and citation style in the header.  

`---`  
`csl: csl/peerj.csl`  
`bibliography: biblio/test_library.bib`  
`---`
 
* The Citation Style Language (*.csl*) file specifies the reference format.     
  
* It is an open XML-based language to describe the formatting of citations and bibliographies. Reference management programs using *.csl* include Zotero, Mendeley and Papers.    
  
* Most journals should have a *.csl* file be on this [github repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). But you could create your own.  

* A *.bib* file contains the bibliographic information of your document. 

* Here, I created a  a *.bib* file in the reference management software [Papers3](https://www.readcube.com/papers/mac). 
 
* But now, I often copy *.bib* reference directly from google scholar.   
![](../figures/gs.png){width=500px}


## Citations: examples  
* Example: The bioinformatics program *BLAST* [@altschul1997gapped] has been cited nearly 70,000 times!  

* These are three random references [eg. @ThibertPlante:2010vw;@Wagner:2012hw;@Yoshida:2014bn].  
  
* Citations go inside square brackets [  ] and are separated by semicolons (;). 

* Each citation must have a unique key, composed of â@â + the citation identifier from the *.bib* database.  

* A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text. For example, Stephen Altschul and a bunch of other people [-@altschul1997gapped] have been cited 70,000 times. 

## Exercice 6 (10 min.)
* Create a library (`.bib` file) with the references for your five favorite scientific papers.

* Find and use another Citation Style Language (e.g. Nature, PLOS ONE, Indian Journal Of Dermatology, etc.).
